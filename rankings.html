            <h1>Rankings</h1>
            <p>In this page we have a set of different group rankings and graphs for you to peruse!</p>
            <h2>Leaderboard Graph</h2>
            <img style="width:80%" src="Assets/graph2.png"/>
            <p>This graph shows the movement of contestants over the course of the last month and how tight our bumholes are in this race</p>
            <h2>Poopiest Days of the Month</h2>
            <img style="width:70%" src="Assets/graph5.png"/>
            <p>This graph shows groups number of poops over the course of May each day, clearly we had a strong beginning and a busy 30th probably
                in preparation for this update. Nonetheless pretty normalised over the course of the month.
            </p>
            <h2>Easiest to Please</h2>
            <img style="width:70%" src="Assets/graph3.png"/>
            <p>This pie chart shows the total amount of likes/reactions sent by each user to any message or meme. Who is the easiest to please
                with your content? Does this devalue their liking? Does the reverse happen for those that have liked less things?
            </p>
            <h2>Most Supportive Pooper</h2>
            <img style="width:70%" src="Assets/graph4.png"/>
            <p>On the flip-side, when focusing these likes solely on messages that contain an update we may consider these likes as supportive
                poop likes, to help you through the process.
